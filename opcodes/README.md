# Opcodes folder

This folder contains data and utilities required to generate
`src/data/instructions.rs` file.

## `riscv-opcodes` utility

The `instr_dict.json` file is generated by the official
[RISC-V opcodes](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-opcodes) utility,
that contains definitions of the entire ISA (including all official
extensions) and generators to produce instructions data in various formats.

To generate the JSON file with the above tool, execute:

```bash
./parse.py 'rv*'
```

The argument of the tool is a space-separated list of extensions
(each starting with `rv_`, `rv32_` or `rv64_` prefix).
The `'rv*'` argument generates all instructions.
